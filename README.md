Finite State Machine Educational Tools:
Implementing Equivalence Testing and State Minimization Algorithms
```

6CCS3PRJ Final Year Project for King's College London

# Todo:

-   add prettier
-   state string for table filling
-   common algorithm status type (initial, final)
-   move general components from table filling visualization to algorithm visualization (e.g. mode switch between eq testing)
