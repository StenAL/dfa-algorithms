Finite State Machine Educational Tools: Implementing Equivalence Testing and State Minimization Algorithms

6CCS3PRJ Final Year Project for King's College London

## About

This project aims to implement and visualize three [Finite Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
algorithms used for [state minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization) (SM) and equivalence testing (ET):

-   The Table-Filling Algorithm (SM, ET)
-   The n lg n Hopcroft Algorithm (SM, ET)
-   The (Nearly) Linear Algorithm (ET)

Additionally, variants of these algorithms that produce witness strings to indicate whether two DFA are equivalent
are also implemented.

Further detail on these algorithms can be found in the report accompanying the project, found [here]().

## Development

To run or develop this software locally, a local installation of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required.

The software can be run as follows:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Install necessary using `npm install`
3. Run the local development server `npm run start`
4. Access the site at `localhost:3000`

Tests can be run using `npm run test`

## Todo:
