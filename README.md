Finite State Machine Educational Tools: 
Implementing Equivalence Testing and State Minimization Algorithms
```


6CCS3PRJ Final Year Project for King's College London

# Todo:
* add prettier
* state string for table filling
* common algorithm status type (initial, final)
* move general components from table filling visualization to algorithm visualization (e.g. mode switch between eq testing)
